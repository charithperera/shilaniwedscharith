              <p>As someone that moved to Cooma from Sri Lanka and grew up in Canberra, I learned to love the cold. Moving to Brisbane was probably the sweatiest decision I ever made. It was of course worth it to give Shilani easier access to annoy me. My love for the cold and Shilanis constant need to cover herself in a blanket is and will always be our biggest contention. People often have a hard time keeping track of what city I’m living in and what job I’m doing. I certainly won’t deny that I’m a hard one to keep track off.  Trying to explain what I have done and what I do will probably need another whole website so let’s just say I play with computers for a living. In my free time gym is usually pretty high my priority list. I love old school hip hop and finding good music has become an ever surmountable challenge.</p>

              <p>After a bit of travelling around early in my life, we ended up calling the beautiful and sunny Queensland Home – some 1000+kms away from Charith. Growing up in Brisbane & Gold Coast, it was nothing short of fun! My huge passion for Sri Lankan dancing (as Charith calls it – my FOB side), took up most of my life, studying Dentistry on the Gold Coast was always “entertaining” and the heat and sunshine were always my friend. Moving to Melbourne was the best thing I’ve done in my life (next to convincing Charith to date me!) but has made me realise – I am always going to be that friend who is ALWAYS cold. These days, in between working hard and early morning gym sessions, my passion is to cook yummy foods to fit our gym junkie macros. I love being creative and taking on board way too many projects than I can fit in a day – I like the challenge of never having a dull moment!!</p>

He’s always there for a laugh and he remains my go to source for real music.</p>

Late nights on MSN and hours on end of Call of Duty became our rituals. While we don’t see each other that often any more catching up is always a blast and kicking back with a glass of Chivas or Monkey Shoulder has become our new routine.</p>

Hanging out with Dulshan is just great fun and you never know what he’s going to say next.</p>

              <p>Budj was my very first friend and I distinctly remember hiding behind my mum as I was introduced to him when I was five. From there we grew up together in Cooma, sometimes holding hands at school and being teased about it. As the years went by we moved apart but we continued to spend the holidays together. Playing video games, getting caught by the police, and getting up to mischief is how we spent them. He is now the third leg in our infamous tripod and he remains one of my best and closest friends.</p>

              <p>Alex is one of my oldest high school friends and is renowned for having sold me a ‘genuine’ copy of Star Craft for a nice profit. That’s ok though because for almost two years I managed to sell my mums curry chicken sandwiches to him for $2 a pop giving me access to Sausage Rolls and Meat Pies. Alex is one of the nicest and most genuine guys I’ve ever met. It’s an absolute pleasure seeing him and his family every time I’m in Canberra.</p>

              <p>Everyone will agree that Kosal is one of the most elusive people in the world. I met him in my early days at ANU and we bonded over our passion for breakdancing. Ultimately this passion led nowhere but I’ll always remember our Saturdays trying to master backflips while Anthony went to the gym to lift weights. As elusive as he is he will always be my friend that can turn a dull night into a party just by showing up.</p>

We would end the week religiously with Friday night at Tongue & Groove and Saturday night at Monkey Bar chasing the best old school we could find in Canberra. This was our routine and we stuck to it like a vigorous weight lifting routine. Times have certainly changed but he remains one of the funniest and best friends I have.</p>

One in particular was when she was helping me get Charith’s attention by dancing together at a club 2 years before we started dating. Charith however didn't even flutter an eye at us!

Since Charith and I have been together, Thilini and I have shared a lot of heart to hearts. I'm so excited to be soon calling her my sister, and even though Thilini now lives even further away from us (it feels like a whole country away!) every time we see each other we’re always bonding and becoming closer still.</p>

Nims has been there for me through all my highs and lows, and with her advice I know I’m most likely not to be doing something completely crazy :P</p>

In fact before then AJ used to think I was a “Stuck up b***”!!! Obviously her opinion of me has now changed (I HOPE!) and has become one of my most loyal friends, who even if she knows that you’re completely wrong, will fight and stick up for you no matter what! My favourite memory of AJ is when she was ready to key someone's car for me – all I had to do was give her the OK!

              One from the Gold Coast and the other from Canberra. We’d known each other for so long but all it apparently took was a few drinks, a charming Gold Coast nightclub and Beyoncé’s Single Ladies to push us closer. After a year of long distance Charith decided to step up and move to Brisbane. Here we truly got to know each other as we moved in together and started to become one person. Early morning gym sessions, calorie counted food and Saturday night dates became our weekly routine. Two years later we moved the party to Melbourne. Here we got engaged and continued our journey together. Now we eagerly await the 9th of September to take that next big step in </br><strong>our story</strong>.

              <h4>Getting Around</h4>
              <p>There’s a few ways to get around Brisbane. These include bus, ferry, train, taxis and Uber. If you want to use the bus, ferry or train system you’ll need to obtain a Go Card. The easiest place to purchase these is at any 7-Eleven, select Newsagents or a Railway station. Our top pick for getting around is definitely Uber. If you’re already on the Uber bandwagon you’ll have no issues getting around Brisbane.</p>

              <h4>Attractions</h4>
              <p>There’s plenty to see in Brisbane Australia. Exploring South Bank was one of our favourites as it has some great spots for food and entertainment. If you feel like going for a drive we recommend Mount Coot-tha Botanic Gardens to enjoy Brisbane from above. There’s Queen Street Mall to get your shopping fix and if you get a chance jump on a CityCat ferry to see Brisbane River.</p>

              <h4>Accomodation</h4>
              <p>Any Hotel within the CBD will provide you with a short Uber or Taxi ride to Victoria Park. Some of the closer hotels include Meriton on Herschel, Mantra Richmont, and Hotel Grand Chancellor. Don’t be afraid to explore some of the nicer offerings in the city though as Victoria Park is just a stones throw away. <a href="https://www.booking.com/s/d5e5936f" target="_blank">Booking.com</a> is our favourite choice for online bookings.

              <h4>What to Wear</h4>
              <p>Brisbane is hot and there’s no way around that. You’ll be coming in Spring though so it won’t be too bad. Temperatures will be between 25 to 30 with a bit of humidity. There is however a chance of rain, and when it rains in Brisbane it pours. We suggest you pack an assortment of attire but mostly cater for a warm and somewhat humid weekend.</p>
